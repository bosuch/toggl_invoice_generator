#Toggl Invoice Generator

This is a python script to pull a client's billable hours via the Toggl API and write them to a csv file.

I use Square for invoices, which does not allow uploading, so only the description and hours (in decimal) are tracked.

The credentials.py file needs to contain your workspace ID, email address and API key.
